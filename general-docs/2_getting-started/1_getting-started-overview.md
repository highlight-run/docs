Let's get you up and running with Highlight. **You should be done and able to see a recorded session within 2 minutes!**

## For your client / frontend:

A session in Highlight starts in the client. Installing Highlight on one of our supported platforms is required to start using Highlight. Follow the instructions in our [client / frontend](getting-started/client-sdk/overview) guide to integrate & get started!

## For your backend / server:

Highlight also supports reporting errors from your backend and mapping these to corresponding sessions. This gives you and your team a complete picture of your application, all the way from your user experience to your server-side errors. Follow the instructions in our [backend / server](getting-started/backend-sdk/overview) guide to get started!
